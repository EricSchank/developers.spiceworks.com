## Ratings & Reviews

As IT pros have known for years, Spiceworks is the place to go for IT product
research.  We have over 236,150 customer reviews on over 41,420 products in 280
different categories!  It's a wealth of information that can only be found on
Spiceworks, and it's growing day by day.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could easily put these product ratings and reviews on
your own website?  With Spiceworks Ratings and Reviews Syndication, you can -
for free!  All you need is one little code snippet to add a Spiceworks badge to
your product site.  When a user clicks on the badge, a relevant product review
pops up right there, with links to even more reviews of the product on
Spiceworks.
